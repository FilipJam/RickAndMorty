Small website showcasing my ability to communicate with public APIs. The API in use here is the Rick and Morty API.



## Running the App
### Prerequisites
This is a node app so you will need to have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) installed. The app was developed with the LTS v18.17.1 version so you may need to downgrade to this version if there are any issues.

Make sure you're in the working directory in the command line before executing these commands

```cd [path/directoryName]```

### Step 1
Install all the dependencies

```npm i```
### Step 2
Run the application

```nodemon```

or if you don't have nodemon installed, use

```node index.js```

if all goes well you should get this message

```
Server running on port 3000
```
